            I am a firm believer that we should cherish our comfort zones -
            those places and spaces that make you feel warm and loved and taken
            care of. Whether it's a memory that you hold tight in times of
            uncertainty, or a treasured gift given to you by a loved one,
            finding ways to feel comfortable in an increasingly uncomfortable
            world is truly important to me.

            I started knitting in 2015 because I needed a sense of comfort. I
            was living alone in a new city with no social circle and nothing to
            do besides work and I wasnâ€™t working very much. On a whim, I saw a
            pair of needles and some yarn in the Target craft aisle, and from
            there I was hooked. When I have extra money to splurge on something,
            I go to the local yarn store. I devour YouTube Videos, books, blogs,
            articles, anything to help me hone in a new skill or technique.
            After a long day, I unwind by coming home and finding my spot on the
            couch and picking up my needles. I am always trying to improve my
            craft, from learning new stitches and patterns, to attempting and
            sometimes succeeding at making designs of my own.

            Around 2018, I decided that I wanted to share this craft with
            others. I started by making small items for friends and family on
            holidays and special occasions. I discovered my love for a technique
            of knitting called Intarsia, and I started designing baby blankets
            as gifts for baby showers. For me, the act of giving something
            personalized and practical was my way of giving comfort to the
            people I love and care for. That love of giving began to mesh with
            my love for creating and designing, and soon I was branching out and
            making many different types of items, but they all share one common
            characteristic - they are made with the intention of offering
            comfort to those who need it.

            My hope for Fat Betty Knits is that it can help you comfort your
            loved ones by finding a meaningful gift to give, or that it can help
            you comfort yourself by finding an item that you can use and know it
            was made with love and compassion. Fat Betty Knits are little
            material reminders that we are all in this world together and while
            we're here we should love our closest people as much as we can.
